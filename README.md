# Fireside

## Overview

Fireside is a public-facing link aggregator meant to be used by a single user.

Think of it as a blog full of links and the occasional text post, or if you prefer, a read-only subreddit.

Fireside is developed in Go and Inertia (using Svelte) and it's still no ready for release.
